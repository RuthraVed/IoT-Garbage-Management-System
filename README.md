# IoT-Garbage-Management-System
As a BE final year project, I developed a web based IoT App for Urban Garbage Management. 

### Objective
* Applying IoT technology (electronics and applications) to the current urban waste management scenario and enable a two way communication between the infrastructure deployed in the city and the operators/administrators.
* Achieve a centralized system for real-time monitoring of garbage/waste.

### Technologies Used
The Project has two prominent parts:-
1. Software Part - The Web App
2. Hardware Part - The on-field IoT hardware ([Arduino Mega 2560] & [ESP-8266 Wifi-Module])

Technologies used for the Web App are : 
  - HTML      : for designing web structure 
  - CSS       : for giving asthetic look
  - JS        : for controlling the web pages on client side
  - JSP       : for Back-end computation

## NOTE:
  * **[DAO Design Pattern]** throughout the application.
  * This project was done local server managed by the [XAMPP].
  * Database used was **MY SQL**, again managed by _PHPMyAdmin_
  * It also a 'projectdb.sql' file, an exported sql file which can be be imported to have the same structured database.
